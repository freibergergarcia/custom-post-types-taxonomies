# WordPress-related plugin

_anything_ WordPress Related, starting with:

- Custom Taxonomies
- Custom Post Types

## Why?

I started helping a friend with a WordPress project with the idea of only using WordPress out-of-the-box
functionalities. The first problem I faced was when I tried to create a custom taxonomy and realised I could only do it
by code. The same is true for post types. Many plugins do that, but the ones I found were obsolete, not following best
practices. 

It would be good to have a reliable plugin maintained by the community with some basics; we will start with post-types
and taxonomies, and if the plugin gains traction, who knows what we might build.

Despite working with VIP WordPress Enterprise since 2020, I have never published a plugin, so that it will be a good learning
exercise.
